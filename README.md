Spring 2023; UofSC - CSCE 190: Computing in the Modern World
------------------------------------------------------------

This repository houses a concise portfolio-based website that I developed during my CSCE 190 class. Throughout the course, I 
collaborated with a team of classmates, fostering relationships that evolved over the semester. Together, we built a strong team
chemistry, diligently adhered to project timelines, and successfully showcased our completed projects on the website.

In addition to the website project, our team delved into the prevalent issue of time management among students. The problem statement 
highlighted the challenges associated with time allocation for students juggling academic commitments, hobbies, clubs, and other school 
activities. We utilized various tools and methodologies to explore potential solutions.

The affinity diagram, categorizing ideas into distinct classifications like Hurdles, Features, Application Type, Tech Stack, and Product Ideas, 
exemplifies the depth of our ideation process. Furthermore, the creation of team personas, such as Samantha Reynolds, provided valuable insights 
into the experiences of students dealing with time management challenges.

Our team also contributed storyboards, sketches, a paper prototype, and a hi-fi prototype for a Time Management Website/Application. 
These visual representations not only underscored our innovative solutions but also provided a tangible glimpse into the real-world application
of our conceptualizations.

In conclusion, our collaborative efforts not only resulted in the successful completion of the assigned project but also demonstrated
our commitment to addressing pertinent issues within the student community. Through teamwork, creativity, and dedication, our contributions
aimed to provide meaningful insights into the complexities of time management for students.
