UofSC - CSCE 190: Computing in the Modern World

Github Page Portfolio (HTML and CSS)

------------------------------------------------------------

This repository houses a concise portfolio-based website that I developed during my CSCE 190 class. Throughout the course,
I collaborated with a team of classmates, fostering relationships that evolved over the semester. Together, we built strong
team chemistry, diligently adhered to project timelines, and successfully showcased our completed projects on the website.

In addition to the website project, our team delved into the prevalent issue of time management among students. The problem
statement highlighted the challenges associated with time allocation for students juggling academic commitments, hobbies,
clubs, and other school activities. As part of the project, I took the lead in implementing HTML and CSS for the website,
ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user experience.

We utilized various tools and methodologies to explore potential solutions. The affinity diagram, categorizing ideas into
distinct classifications like Hurdles, Features, Application Type, Tech Stack, and Product Ideas, exemplifies the depth of
our ideation process. Furthermore, the creation of team personas, such as Samantha Reynolds, provided valuable insights into
the experiences of students dealing with time management challenges.

Our team also contributed storyboards, sketches, a paper prototype, and a hi-fi prototype for a Time Management Website/
Application. These visual representations not only underscored our innovative solutions but also provided a tangible glimpse
into the real-world application of our conceptualizations.

In conclusion, our collaborative efforts not only resulted in the successful completion of the assigned project but also
showcased my proficiency in HTML and CSS, contributing to a website that addresses pertinent issues within the student community.
Through teamwork, creativity, and dedication, our contributions aimed to provide meaningful insights into the complexities of
time management for students.
